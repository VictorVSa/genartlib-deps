   The tightness parameter controls how sharp the corners will be,

   full sharpness, and 0.25 creates maximum smoothness.

   The depth parameter controls how many recursive steps will occur.
   The more steps, the smoother the curve is (assuming tightness is
   greater than zero). Suggested values are between 1 and 8, with a
   good default being 4.

   When points form a closed polygon, it's recommended that the start
   point be repeated at the end of points to avoid a gap."
